# Ajax Submission for the WordPress Grunion Contact Form Plugin

Every time a page reloads to submit a form, a puppy dies. This plugin is the saviour of puppies. 

Grunion Ajax submits a [Grunion Contact Form](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/grunion-contact-form/) using Ajax. It makes it super fast for visitors to submit a form and in so doing, makes your site more attractive to members of the opposite sex. 

The Grunion Ajax Javascript file is only loaded if the post or page in question includes the Grunion `[contact-form]` shortcode, so it's efficient too.

The only caveat, Ajax submission has not been tested for Grunion Forms included in a widget. 


## Installation

You know the drill. 

1. Unzip and upload `/grunion-ajax/` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress

Grunion Ajax will apply to any form added with the `[contact-form]` shortcode.
